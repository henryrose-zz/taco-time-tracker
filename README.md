TacoTimeNW is more than just fast-casual restaurant with delicious Northwest takes on traditional mexican fare. Taco Time Tracker lets you collect stats on which taco time locations you've visted. 

## Getting Started
So far all this repo contains is a script that parses the html from https://tacotimenw.com/find-us/ and saves it to json.  This is in ```utils/suck-locations.js```.

Try it yourself:
```
clone repo
npm install
node utils/suck-locations.js
```
